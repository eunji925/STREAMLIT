The XZ backdoor refers to a malicious backdoor that was introduced into the Linux utility xz within the liblzma library in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1. This backdoor was introduced by an account using the name "Jia Tan" and was discovered in February 2024. The backdoor allows an attacker who has a specific Ed448 private key to execute remote code on the affected Linux system. This vulnerability has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) number CVE-2024-3094 and has been given the highest possible CVSS score of 10.0.

XZ Utils, which includes the xz program, is a set of free software command-line lossless data compressors for Unix-like operating systems and, from version 5.0 onwards, Microsoft Windows. XZ Utils uses the Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm (LZMA) for compression and decompression.

A backdoor in computing is a method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer, product, or embedded device. It is often used for securing remote access to a computer or obtaining access to plaintext in cryptosystems. Backdoors can take the form of a hidden part of a program, a separate program, code in the firmware of hardware, or parts of an operating system. They can be used to gain access to privileged information, corrupt or delete data, or transfer information within networks.

At the time of the discovery of the XZ backdoor, the affected versions had not been widely deployed to production systems but were present in development versions of major Linux distributions. The backdoor was discovered by software developer Andres Freund, who announced his findings on March 29, 2024.
