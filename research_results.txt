In February 2024, a significant security incident occurred involving the XZ Utils, specifically the liblzma library, which is part of the XZ Utils set of free software command-line lossless data compressors. A malicious backdoor was introduced into the Linux utility xz in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1. This backdoor was added by an account under the name "Jia Tan" and was designed to give an attacker with a specific Ed448 private key the ability to execute code remotely on Linux systems affected by this vulnerability.

The backdoor was assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier CVE-2024-3094 and received the highest possible severity score of 10.0 on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). This score indicates a critical level of risk.

XZ Utils, which includes the xz program, is widely used in Unix-like operating systems and, from version 5.0 onwards, also in Microsoft Windows. The utility employs the Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm (LZMA) for compression and decompression of data.

At the time the backdoor was discovered, the compromised versions of xz had not been widely deployed to production systems but were present in the development versions of major Linux distributions. The discovery of the backdoor was made by software developer Andres Freund, who announced his findings on March 29, 2024.

A backdoor in computing is a method that allows bypassing normal authentication or encryption to gain unauthorized access to a system or data. Backdoors can be hidden in software, firmware, or even parts of an operating system. They can be used for various purposes, including securing remote access to a computer, obtaining privileged information, corrupting or deleting data, or transferring information within networks. Some backdoors are installed secretly, while others are known and may even have legitimate uses, such as allowing manufacturers to restore user passwords.

The incident with the XZ Utils backdoor serves as a reminder of the importance of vigilance and security in software development and distribution, especially in widely used utilities that form part of the critical infrastructure of many computing environments.
